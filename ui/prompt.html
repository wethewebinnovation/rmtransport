description. this details should be accessed by lrbilllayout.vue i explain about lrbilllayout.vue in the last as of now
i will just post continously about each page







TrashLayout.vue: here i could not create edit or delete anything. if i delete a data in lrbillslayout.vue page it should
be moved to this page. if i restore it should go back to lrbillslayout.vue page
but every lr no created as new should be created at only one time even after deleted from lrbilllayout page it should
not be generated again. for example RM/2025/08/11 is a lr entry in lrbillslayout.vue if i delete it it will move to
trash page, and if i again create new lr bill the lr no should start from RM/2025/08/12 concept is once created lr no
should not be used again (auto generate again)
